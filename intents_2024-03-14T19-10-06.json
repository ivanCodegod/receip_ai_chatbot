        "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\r\n\r\nDefrost shrimp by putting in cold water, then drain and toss with wine, oil, salt, and pepper. Place in oven-safe dish and allow to sit at room temperature while you make the butter and garlic mixture.\r\n\r\nIn a small bowl, mash the softened butter with the rest of the ingredients and some salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nSpread the butter mixture evenly over the shrimp. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until hot and bubbly. If you like the top browned, place under a broiler for 1-3 minutes (keep an eye on it). Serve with lemon wedges and French bread.\r\n\r\nNote: if using fresh shrimp, arrange for presentation. Starting from the outer edge of a 14-inch oval gratin dish, arrange the shrimp in a single layer cut side down with the tails curling up and towards the center of the dish. Pour the remaining marinade over the shrimp. "

        "Preheat oven to 200F.\r\n\r\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper. In a small bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks, then whisk in the milk, 2 tablespoons of melted butter and lemon juice. Add the yolk mixture to the flour mixture and, using a wooden spoon, stir until well blended. The batter will be lumpy.\r\n\r\nIn a clean bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Using a silicone spatula, fold about one-third of the egg whites into the batter to lighten it, then fold in the rest just until no white streaks remain. Stir in fresh dill.\r\n\r\nBrush the wells of the ebelskiver pan with some of the remaining melted butter and place over medium heat. When the butter starts to bubble, add about 1 tablespoon batter to each well. Working quickly, carefully spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the smoked salmon into the center of each pancake, then spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the cream cheese on top. Top each with another 1 tablespoon batter. (Alternatively, gently mix the cream cheese and salmon together. Spoon about 1 teaspoon into the center of each pancake)\r\n\r\nCook until the bottoms of the pancakes are lightly browned and crisp, 3-5 minutes. Use 2 short wooden skewers to turn all the  pancakes and cook until lightly browned on the second side, about 3 minutes longer.\r\n\r\nTransfer the finished pancakes to a platter and keep warm  in the oven while you repeat to make 2 more batches. Serve right away."

        "TO MAKE SHELL: Preheat oven to 300 degrees. In mixer bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Beat in salt and cream of tartar and beat until soft peaks form. Add sugar, a tablespoon at a time, beating after each addition. Continue until very stiff peaks form. Fold in nuts and vanilla. Lightly butter a metal 8-inch pie plate. (Do NOT use glass.) Spoon meringue into pan lightly, building up the edges to come at least 1\/2 inch above the side of the pan. Bake in preheated 300 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes until light brown. Cool completely before adding filling. TO MAKE FILLING: Melt chocolate and water in a pan over hot, but not boiling, water, stirring occasionally, to blend. Add vanilla and chocolate mixture (cooled) to whipped cream and pile into meringue shell, swirling top with spatula. Be sure to cool the chocolate mixture before adding to the whipped cream. If it is too warm, the mixture will thin out. If this happens, chill until it is thick enough to put in shell."
