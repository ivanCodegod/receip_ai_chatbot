        "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\r\n\r\nDefrost shrimp by putting in cold water, then drain and toss with wine, oil, salt, and pepper. Place in oven-safe dish and allow to sit at room temperature while you make the butter and garlic mixture.\r\n\r\nIn a small bowl, mash the softened butter with the rest of the ingredients and some salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nSpread the butter mixture evenly over the shrimp. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until hot and bubbly. If you like the top browned, place under a broiler for 1-3 minutes (keep an eye on it). Serve with lemon wedges and French bread.\r\n\r\nNote: if using fresh shrimp, arrange for presentation. Starting from the outer edge of a 14-inch oval gratin dish, arrange the shrimp in a single layer cut side down with the tails curling up and towards the center of the dish. Pour the remaining marinade over the shrimp. "

        "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees halfway through onion cooking.\r\n\r\nSlice the onions and saute in 4 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat; the longer you cook them - as long as 35 minutes - the sweeter they will be.  Sprinkle in crushed red pepper.\r\n\r\nMelt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter.  Mix with the crushed crackers, then press the mixture into the bottom and sides of a glass pie plate to form a crust.  Prebake crust for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nLightly beat the eggs and milk together in a small bowl.\r\n\r\nSpoon the onions into the crust, then pour the egg mixture over them.  Sprinkle with Parmesan.\r\n\r\nBake for 30-40 minutes until set and golden."
